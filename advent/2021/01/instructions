While on a boat an elf threw the Sleigh Keys into the ocean.

We get into a submarine with an experimental antenna that can track the keys.

We scan the sea floor to find the keys. Each line is the sea floor depth

# Part 1

* Find out how quickly the depth increases
- Count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement.

# Part 2

   Using every single measurement isn't that useful, 
   so we consider sums of three-measurement sliding window. 
- Count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous sliding window sum
