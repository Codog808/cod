The Dimensions

All Dimensions exists with the other dimensions; Does the observer depend on how the dimension really is?

To observe and have shapes it means that time must exist. Time itself is another dimension. If anything, we are constantly making changes to the 1D world through our own observation; Because of this the time dimension must always be added to any dimension. So every dimension of space has an added dimension to it. =

1D space.
In the land of the first dimensions only points and lines can exists. It is most similar to a number line containing all integers spanning from negative infinity to positive infinity and all meeting at the origin (zero). 
However, it is when a creature of the first dimension exists is when the other shapes can take its form.
As a shape passes through the first dimension, adding the dimension of time and the abilty to observe for this 1D creature.
A square could be seen as a line from one point to another, existing as a line, it passes through the dimension of this 1D creature. Yet this creature would be stuck watching the square passing through its world as a point depending on where it sits, either on the negative side or positive side of it's world. Circles and spheres to squares and cubes would formulate different types of lines through this time of obeservation. A parabola, or shapes without a filled center, or simply functions, could entrap this creature. as the parabola passes through the space it could block the creature between its symmetrical segments, and either is expands forever or squishes it as it moves the parabola's origin pass the dimension.

   In the land of the second dimension, a land that is actaully 3 dimensions as we observers make it so, shapes can be made
