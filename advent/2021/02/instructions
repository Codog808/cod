Now we need to figure out how to piolet the submarine.

Submarine can take a series of commands:
forward x; increases hoizontal position by x units
down x; increases depth by x units
up x; decreases the depth by x units

forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward 2

# part 1
- horizontal (h) and depth (d) both start at 0.
- each int after command adds or subtract from that corresponding movement.
* What would you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?

# part 2

Based on the calulation found from the previous part the planned course doesn't make sense.
We mistakenly assumed the process and now, referring the manual, we have found the actual way to do things

We now have to track 'aim'.

down; increases aim by x
up; decreases aim by x
forward; 
   1. increases horizontal position
   2. increases your depth by your aim multiplied by x

* What do you get now if you multiply your final h position to your final d position.
