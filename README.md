# learning GIT
Having to use git on a daily basis to have my projects accessible on my many machines is cool - I wonder if there should be a different way I should store these git repos instead of using github itself. What I find is that there is a way to understand git, the steps and the syntax is coming together through use. Everything is learning, it all takes the right way to learn it, from whatever teacher is out there, to be successful at it.
