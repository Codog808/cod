a neuron exists
A neuron can activate or deactivate, depending on the weights and biasof the neuron interacting with an input.
The neuron can take infinite amounts of input and outputs a single output.
- If it was one input one output then the neurons couldn't be connected to one another to create a network of neurons.
- Understanding the meaning of semantics of words is important to visualize and understand meaning and use.
