# learning GIT
Having to use git on a daily basis to have my projects accessible on my many machines is cool - I wonder if there should be a different way I should store these git repos instead of using github itself. What I find is that there is a way to understand git, the steps and the syntax is coming together through use. Everything is learning, it all takes the right way to learn it, from whatever teacher is out there, to be successful at it.
# Rules
1. Keep things related to 3.
2. Every repository must outline the use case of the scripts or what they do.
3. There must be a synopsis for the purpose of the code.
# The Repository Structure
### qs
- shortened/acronym-form of the script.
### /Windows && /Linux
- for generalization, have both made.
### Names
- package or name as the first component of acronyms in order to avoid conflicts.
- Never organize by language, they are all equal.
# Why
- To have order is to have rules, this inherently creates organization in every repository, if I follow them. Regardless of how pointless, order is required to be understood.
