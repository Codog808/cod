The Federal Reserve is owned by bankers of XYZ (unknown), the American currency is tied to the whims of an elite group of weathy individuals. They seem to be working towards the benefit of humankind so they aren't anything to worry about.

Crypto as a means of security for ones safety and the ability to buy whatever the heart desires.
