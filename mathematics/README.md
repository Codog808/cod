Define Mathematics:
- **Algebra**
    - The ability to substitute any value into a function/formula to produce a predictable outcome.
- **Geometry**
    - The ability to visualize mathematics, specifically functions/algebra using a graph.
- **Logic**
    - The ability to know if something is true or false dependent upon certain conditions.

# Mathematics, the brains of computers
- Boolean Algebra is the the basis of Logic for computers
- - A fine tuned combination of True and False while leveraging real world functions create the computers of today
## Create a Logic gate and do math
- coordinates allow us to have screens
- geometry allows us to manipulate data, simplify nueral networks, create images, and games
- physics allows us to understand the speed of our connections and the physical limits
/ Create an Xor gate, and gate, not gate, or gate. Create an adder. have machines which use the outputs of the computer to display, create, or destory due to certain conditions.
