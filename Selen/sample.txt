Ophelia felt all alone, she had no one to trust,
Her lover had killed her father and her love,
Her father is gone due to Hamlet's vicious thrusts,
Ophelia feels as though she is a caged dove,

Her mind, once clear, now clouded, lost in despair,
The weight of her sorrow, too heavy to bear,
In river's embrace, she sought solace and care,
Her world unraveled, a tapestry so rare.

In madness, she sang her haunting, mournful song,
As fragile petals adorned her golden hair,
She slipped beneath the waves, where she now belongs,
A tragic end to a maiden once so fair.

Sweet Ophelia, the victim of fate's cruel game,
In eternal rest, may she find peace from the pain.
