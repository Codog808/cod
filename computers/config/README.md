# Use
- Tools to make coding easier
# Problems 
### Windows
- if committing is an issue, remember that it saves your previous credentials
- win-r keymgr.dll; windows credentials; delete the old github credentials.
# Notes
- woah, actually the message tied to a commit is very important context. Going to implement something for that.
### OKay, now this is being used for what it is meant for
- Please do not have absolute paths written into the activate.ps1
- make sure to implement the message and to fix the absolute path.
- pushing to github as gfs, yikes.
